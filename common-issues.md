# Common Issues


# Styling


## Images


### Image Object Fit:

Avoid using an object-fit set to "stretch" for images. Instead, utilize object-fit: "contain" to ensure images are properly scaled and maintain their aspect ratio.


# Forms


## Validation

It is essential to validate all input fields in a form before submitting it. Ensure error messages are displayed when necessary to guide users through the correction process.
